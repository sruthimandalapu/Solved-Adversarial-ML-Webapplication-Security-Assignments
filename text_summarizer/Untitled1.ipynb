    "As Yogi Berra famously said, it’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future. But had the baseball legend spent any time observing the UN climate negotiations, he could have safely predicted that climate finance will prove to be a key sticking point at COP29 in Baku at the end of this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "‘Who will pay and how much?’ are perennial questions at the climate talks, but this year, the discussions about climate finance will be especially prominent. At COP29, Parties to the Paris Agreement must negotiate a new climate finance goal, to replace the existing commitment from 2009 for developed countries to provide US5.8-5.9 trillion is required to implement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in developing countries up to 2030. They will require US1.5 trillion in renewable energy are required worldwide every year up until 2030, according to IRENA.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these sums are also affordable and beneficial for developed countries. They should be seen in the context of ongoing investments in energy and other infrastructure: around US1.74 trillion was in clean energy. These investments will generate strong returns for their investors and reduce the costs for energy consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, crucially, they should also be seen in the context of the alternative. The latest research estimates that the world economy is already set to face a 19% income reduction within the next 26 years based on the levels of warming we have already locked in. The more we delay and the more the planet heats, the greater the economic costs will be.\n",

    "Laying the foundations for a new finance goal\n",
    "\n",
    "While financial resources are beginning to flow, they are not flowing fast enough, and certainly not flowing to those developing countries where need is greatest and access to finance is most challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UN climate framework provides mechanisms that can enable those flows of climate finance. Back in 2015, parties at the climate talks agreed to establish a “new collective quantified goal” (NCQG) for climate finance. They agreed that the NCQG would be set prior to 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  ultimate size of the NCQG will be a product of the negotiations, but Parties have agreed it must be a significant increase from the floor of US$100 billion annually. For WWF, it must be needs-based and sufficiently ambitious to meet the scale of the challenge we face, and immediately accessible to help countries that are already facing the chaos of a destabilised climate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "While developed countries are expected to provide financial and technical support, developing countries also have a role to play. Parties are due to submit revised NDCs in 2025, presenting how they plan to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. Developing countries have the opportunity to use their NDCs to set out how international climate finance can support them and increase their ambition. To do this, they need to know the finance will be forthcoming.\n",
