There are two kinds of Migration -

Automated Migration
Code based Migration

Automated Migration

Step 1 - Open Package Manger Console from Tools ? NuGet Package Manger ? Package Manger Console.

Step 2 - To enable automated migration run the following command in Package Manager Console.

PM> enable-migrations -EnableAutomaticMigrations:$true

Step 3 - Once the command runs successfully, it creates an internal sealed Configuration class in the Migration folder of your project as shown in the following code.

Step 4 - Set the database initializer in the context class with the new DB initialization strategy MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion.
public MyContext() : base("MyContextDB") {
      Database.SetInitializer(new MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion<MyContext, 
         EFCodeFirstDemo.Migrations.Configuration>("MyContextDB"));
   }
Step 5 - You have set up automated migration. When you execute your application, then it will automatically take care of migration, when you change the model.

Step 6 - To handle the property migration you need to set AutomaticMigrationDataLossAllowed = true in the configuration class constructor.

public Configuration() {
   AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = true;
   AutomaticMigrationDataLossAllowed = true;
   ContextKey = "EFCodeFirstDemo.MyContext";
}
